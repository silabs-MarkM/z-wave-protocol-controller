## What is ZPC?

ZPC is a Linux/macOS based Z-Wave gateway application that functions as a central static controller in Z-Wave networks. It provides the host side functionality of the Z-Wave Controller, and interacts with the Z-Wave network through the Silicon Labs Network Co-Processor (NCP) controller. As a static controller, ZPC remains continuously powered and acts as the primary hub for managing and coordinating communication among all Z-Wave devices in a smart home network. ZPC provides network management, device control, and state synchronization capabilities through an MQTT-based communication interface.

## ZPC features

* **MQTT based communication**: Subscribe to and publish to MQTT topics to control and monitor Z-Wave devices and the network
* **Z-Wave network management**: Add and remove nodes from the network, device control
* **Persistent storage system**: Store the state of the Z-Wave network and devices

ZPC uses a reported/desired value system where all state parameters have a reported value (current state) and a desired value (user-preferred state). When these values differ, ZPC automatically sends the appropriate commands to synchronize the state.

*Supported* means the controller responds to this command class (support handler). *Controlled* means the controller can send commands for this command class (control handler). For full MQTT APIs per command class, see the [Command Classes MQTT Interface](components/command_classes/doc/generated/mqtt_interface.md).

Protocol (Z-Wave), Protocol Long Range, Security 0 (S0), Security 2 (S2), and Transport Service are generated with `protocol: true` and a `generate_commands` allowlist. They are not MQTT-facing. Segmentation stays in the Transport Service wrapper (`transport_service.c`); the Transport Service command class is only a manager registration stub.

## How to run ZPC

### Installing dependencies

#### macOS

```bash
brew install $(cat ci/dependencies/brew-packages.txt)
pip3 install -r ci/dependencies/requirements.txt
```

#### Linux

```bash
apt-get install -y $(cat ci/dependencies/apt-packages-base.txt)
pip3 install -r ci/dependencies/requirements.txt
```

## How to use ZPC

### Setting up the MQTT broker (e.g., [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/download/))

```bash
mosquitto -p 1883
```

### Setting up the NCP

Flash the NCP Serial API Controller firmware and note the serial port it is connected to. For example, `/dev/ttyACM0`.

### Setting up the Switch On/Off device

Flash the Switch On/Off device firmware and consult the [firmware documentation](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/INS14280.pdf). Note the first 5 digits of the device DSK.

### Building ZPC

```bash
# <preset_name>: macos or debian
cmake --workflow --preset <preset_name>
```

On Linux, you can produce a Debian package (`.deb`) after the build; see [docs/packaging-debian.md](docs/packaging-debian.md).

### Configuring ZPC

Use [this configuration file](example_config.yaml) as a template.

Point to your configuration file with:

```bash
--conf <path_to_config_file>
```

To get ZPC running, set these parameters in the template under the `zpc:` section:

- **Serial port** — NCP connection (e.g. the serial port of the flashed NCP):

```yaml
zpc:
  serial: /dev/ttyACM0
```

Alternatively, use IP connection to the NCP:

```yaml
zpc:
  ip_address: '192.168.1.2'
  ip_port: 4901
```

- **Connection log file** — where serial/IP communication of the Z-Wave module is logged:

```yaml
zpc:
  connection_log_file: /path/to/the/log/file/file.log
```

- **Datastore file** — path to the persistent database:

```yaml
zpc:
  datastore_file: /path/to/the/database/file/database.db
```

### Running ZPC

```bash
./build/<preset_name>/applications/zpc/zpc --log.level d
```

ZPC is controlled entirely over MQTT — it does not read from the terminal. For full MQTT API documentation, see the [MQTT API index](components/mqtt_api/doc/mqtt_api_index.md), which links to Discovery, Network Management, SmartStart, Device Interview, and all [Command Class MQTT interfaces](components/command_classes/doc/generated/mqtt_interface.md).

## Switch On/Off Demo

### Step 1: Start the MQTT broker

See above section "Setting up the MQTT broker".

### Step 2: Start ZPC

See above section "Running ZPC".

### Step 3: Add the Switch On/Off device to the network

* Get the Home ID from ZPC by issuing the following command on MQTT

```bash
mosquitto_pub -t "zpc/Discovery" -m '{}'
```

* Home ID will be sent back on the following topic

```bash
zpc/Discovery/Report
```

* Start add process by issuing the following command on MQTT

```bash
mosquitto_pub -t 'zpc/<home_id>/Network/Node/Add' -m '{}'
```

* Enable learn mode on the end device by pushing BTN1
* For S2 inclusion, ZPC publishes to `zpc/<home_id>/Network/RequestedKeys/Report` when the node requests keys and to `zpc/<home_id>/Network/RequestedDSK/Report` when DSK verification is needed. Respond by publishing to `zpc/<home_id>/Network/GrantKeys` (payload: `{"Accept":true,"Keys":<keys>,"CSA":<csa>}`) and/or `zpc/<home_id>/Network/DSK/Accept` (payload: `{"dsk":"<value>"}`).
* Accept DSK on ZPC side by issuing the following command on MQTT

```bash
mosquitto_pub -t 'zpc/<home_id>/Network/DSK/Accept' -m '{"dsk":"12345"}'
```

* When the device interview finishes (per endpoint), ZPC publishes to `zpc/<home_id>/Interview/Report` with payload `{"node_id":<id>,"endpoint_id":<ep>,"status":<code>}`. Subscribe to that topic to know when the device is fully interviewed.

### Step 4: Control the Switch On/Off device via MQTT

At this point the end device is successfully included to the network. To get the
Node ID of that device in the network call the following MQTT API:

```bash
mosquitto_pub -t 'zpc/<home_id>/Network/Node/List' -m '{}'
```

It will reply on the following topic
```bash
zpc/<home_id>/Network/Node/List/Report
```

Node ID of the freshly added end device is in the node_information section
```bash
  ...
  {
      "node_information":{
         "basic_device_class":"4",
         "generic_device_class":"16",
         "listening_protocol":"211",
         "node_id":"2",
         "optional_protocol":"156",
         "specific_device_class":"0"
      },
  ...
```

To switch off the device, publish the following message to the MQTT topic:

```bash
 mosquitto_pub -t 'zpc/<home_id>/<node_id>/ep0/SwitchBinary/Command/SwitchBinarySet' -m '{ "target_value": "0", "duration": "0" }'
```

To switch on the device, publish the following message to the MQTT topic:

```bash
 mosquitto_pub -t 'zpc/<home_id>/<node_id>/ep0/SwitchBinary/Command/SwitchBinarySet' -m '{ "target_value": "255", "duration": "0" }'
```

Subscribe to the following topic to get notified about SwitchBinary state changes

```bash
 mosquitto_sub -v -h localhost -t 'zpc/<home_id>/<node_id>/ep0/SwitchBinary/Report/SwitchBinaryReport'
```

Example transmission

```bash
 zpc/<home_id>/<node_id>/ep0/SwitchBinary/Report/SwitchBinaryReport {"current_value":255,"duration":0,"target_value":255}
```
